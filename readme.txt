Demo of the EasySOA service proxy layer.

Built on top of OW2 FraSCAti, using SCA Intents to provide for SLA (ex. fuse) and other transversal behaviours, in order to achieve the targeted "Information System protective shell" / "SOA sandboxing" features.

See readme files below, and especially in easysoa-demo-proxy-core-scaProxy.
